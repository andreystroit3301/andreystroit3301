# About Me

I'm an amateur programmer that started out learning Java in high school. I took computer science courses for 3 years in high school with the last year being the CS331 data structures and algorithms course at IIT.
During my time learning java I also decided to start teaching myself C++ which I ended up using alot more as I enjoy the lower level coding. I have also taught myself python, but I havent really used it much. 
Most of what I will initially post on here will be Arduino related C++ code as I'm working on a few Arduino projects. I plan to make a few more projects to further explore C++ outside of Arduino development in the future along with some Java projects.
Aside from coding I also tinker with circuit design. Pretty much all of my arduino projects use a custom PCB and required my to create my own circuits which will be posted in the respective arduino project repositories.
I may add some repositories that are just circuit design such as a super capacitor power bank that I started designing.

## Projects I'm Currently Working On
- Arduino Data Structure Library
- Arduino Remote Controlled Tank(no repo yet)
- GameDuino an Arduino Mega based GameBoy style game console(no repo yet)
